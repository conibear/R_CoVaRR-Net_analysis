## CoVaRR-Net Project Analysis using R

### Introduction

Coronarvirus Variants Rapid Response Network (aka. CoVaRR-Net), is a network of interdisciplinary researchers from institutes across Canada created to coordinate, facilitate, support and accelerate rapid response research throughout the country. The goal of this network is to rapidly and efficiently act on the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) by functionally characterizing the virusâ€™s features, including potential for immune escape, and communicating new information in real-time to Canadian public health officials and decision-makers, as well to the broader international scientific community.


The Team is structured by theme and including 10 Pillars, each pillar has its own specialized field which study and analyzed a different biological aspect of variants. As a member of both the Pillar 1 (Immunology & Vaccine Protection) and Pillar 4 (Functional Genomics & Structure-Function of VOCs), my role is to utilized the spike-pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay developed by the Gingras' Lab to assess the neutralizing potential of infection and vaccine-induced antibody responses from blood donors.

### Projects

**The neutralization assay I assisted the teams include the follow**

1. **COV-Breakthrough:** A collaborative project with Gommerman's Laboratory at the University of Toronto

  - This is a project initiated by the Gommerman's lab in response to Health Canada's question: **Does a third dose is required to those who were Omicron infected?**. In this project we will we will examine the antibody and immune response of those who were Omicron infected during the outbreak and in comparison to those who were 3-doses vaccinated.

2. **Recover-QC:** A collaborative project with Decaluwe Laboratory at the University of Montreal

  - This is the stage where we entered to the second wave of COVID and the Canadian introduced the vaccine program and the vaccination timeline to the public. However due to vaccine shortage and the urgency to get everyone vaccinated, we were given an option to get homogenized or mixed vaccine. Here in this project we will examine the antibody response among vaccines group.

3. **Omicron-3M:** A collaborative project with Gommerman's Laboratory at the University of Toronto

  - This is the continuation of the **COV-Breakthrough** where we monitored and analyzed individuals antibody response three months after vaccination, with or without Omicron infections in between doses.

**Projects will constantly update so STAY TUNED!**
