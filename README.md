## CoVaRR-Net Project Analysis using R

**Coronarvirus Variants Rapid Response Network (aka. CoVaRR-Net), is a network of interdisciplinary researchers from institutes across Canada created to coordinate, facilitate, support and accelerate rapid response research throughout the country. The goal of this network is to rapidly and efficiently act on the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) by functionally characterizing the virusâ€™s features, including potential for immune escape, and communicating new information in real-time to Canadian public health officials and decision-makers, as well to the broader international scientific community.**

**The Team is structured by theme and including 10 Pillars, each pillar has its own specializaed field which study and analyzed a different biological aspect of variants. As a memeber of both the Pillar 1 (Immunology & Vaccine Protection) and Pillar 4 (Functioanl Genomics & Structure-Function of VOCs), my role is to utilized th espike-pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay developed by the Gingras' Lab to assess the neutralizing potential of infection and vaccine-induced antibody responses from blood donors.**

**The neutralization assay I assisted the teams include the follow**

**1. COV-Breakthrough: A collaborative project with Gommerman's Laboratory at University of Toronto**

**2. Recover-QC: A collaborative project with Decaluwe Laboratory at University of Montreal**

**Projects will constantly update so STAY TUNED!**
